# CardsAgainstSoftwareDevelopment
Inspired by "Cards against humanity" but aimed for software development.

At the moment the game is single player but I do plan on expanding it to make it multiplayer on the local network.

P.S. I do not have anything against software development, its just a random game idea I had and decided to create it.
